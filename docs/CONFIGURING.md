# How to Configure This Library

To flexibly support various applications, this library is very configuration driven. A handful of configuration properties control everything that this library does.

## Property Location

All properties should be placed in a file called `oauth2.properties` at the root of the classpath.

## Standard OAuth2 Properties

This project supports all the properties from `oauth2-utils`. Please see that project for details about its properties.
